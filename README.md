# Bizaar eShop

https://bizaar-eshop.onrender.com/

## Description
An eCommerce shop built using the MERN stack along with Redux Toolkit, based largely on [Brad Traversy's eCommerce App](https://github.com/bradtraversy/proshop-v2). This project was originally made for an *Intro to Software Engineering* course at Oregon State University, with the intention of creating a more robust project using the **Agile** project management methodology. The Bizaar eShop connects to my [Email Notification Microservice](https://github.com/dreniff3/osu-cs361-microservice) to send e-mail receipts to users who successfully pay for a completed order.
